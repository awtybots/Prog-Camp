## Important Notes

- **Aim logs only appear when RT is held** (`isAiming = true`). If you don't see `Drive/Aim/` keys updating, the aim command isn't running.
- **Auto recovery logs run always** during auto and teleop.
- All `Drive/` logs come from `SwerveSubsystem.periodic()`. All `Shooter/` logs come from `Shooter.periodic()`. Controller input logs come from `RobotContainer`.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Drivetrain Issues

| Symptom | What to check | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Robot drifting when driving straight | `Drive/CommandedOmega` should be ~0, check `Drive/ActualOmega` | If actual omega is nonzero with zero commanded, heading correction may be off or gyro is drifting |
| Robot not driving at full speed | `Drive/CommandedFieldVelocity` vs `Drive/FieldVelocity` | If commanded is low, check for `scaleTranslation`. If actual is low but commanded is high, mechanical issue |
| Odometry jumping | `Drive/Pose` on field view, check for sudden teleports | Vision measurement with bad data got accepted. Check Limelight rejection thresholds |
| Modules fighting each other | `Drive/CurrentModuleStates` vs `Drive/DesiredModuleStates` | If angles are far apart, module PID tuning issue or encoder offset wrong |

### Aiming / SOTM Issues

| Symptom | What to check | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Aim lagging behind while moving | Check if `aimLookahead` is set in AimAtHub. Graph `ErrorDegHub` | Without lookahead, aim chases current position instead of leading. Should have 0.2s lookahead |
| Aim oscillating, never settling | Graph `ErrorDegHub` — if it bounces +/- degrees | Heading PID gains too aggressive, or `aimFeedforward` values need tuning |
| Aim not tracking at all | Check `Drive/Aim/DynamicHubPose` exists in log | If missing, `isAiming` is false — AimAtHub isn't running. Check command scheduling |
| SOTM lead looks wrong | Compare `DynamicHubPose` vs `StaticHubPose` on field view | Lead should point opposite to robot velocity. If not, check `RobotVelX`/`RobotVelY` for noisy readings |
| Aim stops when shooter reaches speed | Check if AimAtHub gets interrupted in command scheduler | `lockCommand` or another drivebase command may be taking over. AimAtHub should hold drivebase the entire time |
| Shots missing at distance | Graph `DistanceToHubM` and correlate with `Shooter/LUTDistance` | If they don't match, the shooter RPM lookup is using a different distance than the aim system |
| `IsLocked` is true unexpectedly | Check `Drive/Aim/IsLocked` | When locked, SOTM is bypassed and static hub pose is used. Robot must be stationary (no sticks) for this |

### Shooting Sequence Issues

| Symptom | What to check | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Nothing happens when RT pressed | `Shooting/RTHeld` should be true | If false, trigger not registering. If true, check `Shooting/InAllianceZone` — may have taken wrong branch |
| Shooter spins but never feeds | `Shooting/AimLock1Deg` — is it ever true? | Feeding waits for shooter at speed AND aim within 1 deg. If aim never locks, check `ErrorDegHub` |
| Feeding starts then immediately stops | `Shooting/AimLock3Deg` — does it flicker? | Feeding has a 3 deg `onlyWhile` gate. If aim oscillates around 3 deg, feeding cuts in and out |
| Shooting when not aimed at hub | `Shooting/AimLock1Deg` should be false until aimed | If true when not aimed, the aimLock threshold may be too loose or the error calculation is wrong |
| Passing not working in opponent zone | `Shooting/InAllianceZone` should be false | If true, robot thinks it's in alliance zone. Check zone boundary thresholds (182in blue, 469in red) |
| Ferry feeding cuts out | `Shooting/FerryAimLock3Deg` — is it stable? | Same as hub — if aim oscillates near 3 deg, feeding stops. May need wider threshold |

### Shooter Motor Issues

| Symptom | What to check | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Shooter not spinning up | `Shooter/TargetRPM` — is it nonzero? | If zero, the shoot command isn't running. If nonzero, check `AppliedVolts` — motor may not be responding |
| Shooter slow to reach speed | Graph `Shooter/TargetRPM` vs actual RPMs over time | Large gap = PID too slow, voltage sag, or mechanical drag |
| Left/Right shooter mismatch | Compare `Left1RPM`/`Left2RPM` vs `Right1RPM`/`Right2RPM` | If one side lags, check for mechanical binding or motor issue on that side |
| Kicker not feeding | `Shooter/KickerLeftRPM` and `KickerRightRPM` should be nonzero | If zero, kicker command isn't running. Check the shooting sequence composition |
| Shots inconsistent at same distance | `Shooter/LUTCurrentTargetRPM` should be stable | If RPM fluctuates, the distance reading is noisy — check `LUTDistance` |

### Intake / Hopper Issues

| Symptom | What to check | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Intake not running | `Intake/DesiredPercent` — should be nonzero when commanded | If zero, command isn't reaching the intake. If nonzero but `AppliedVolts` is zero, motor issue |
| Fuel not transferring to shooter | `Hopper/TransferDesiredPercent` and `Hopper/PushdownDesiredPercent` | Both should be nonzero during the feed sequence |
| Fuel jamming | Check if `Pushout/DesiredPercent` is cycling (agitate) | If not, the agitate command may not be running in the shooting sequence |

### Auto Recovery Issues

| Symptom | What to check | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Recovery triggering too early | Graph `PathFollowingErrorM` — what's the normal tracking error? | If it regularly hits 0.12-0.14m during normal runs, the 0.15m threshold is too tight. Increase to 0.2-0.25m |
| Recovery not triggering when knocked | `IsOffPath` should flip true when hit | If it stays false, the threshold is too loose or `targetPathPose` isn't updating (check `configurePathPlannerLogging`) |
| Recovery flickering | `IsOffPath` rapidly toggles true/false | Robot is hovering at the threshold boundary. Need hysteresis or a wider threshold |
| Robot recovers but ends up in wrong spot | Overlay `TargetPathPose` and `Drive/Pose` on field view | Recovery path may not end where the next auto step expects. Check recovery path endpoints |
| Auto segment does nothing | Check `Auto/PathLoadError` for an error message | If populated, the path file failed to load and the segment silently returned a no-op. Verify path file names in PathPlanner |
| Can't tell if recovery actually fired | Check `Auto/RecoveryTriggered` — should flip true | `IsOffPath` can be true without recovery running (e.g., checked twice). `RecoveryTriggered` confirms the recovery branch was taken |
| Don't know which path is running | Check `Auto/CurrentPath` — updates at each segment start | Changes from main path name to recovery path name when recovery fires. Correlate with `RecoveryTriggered` |
| Auto shooting not firing | Check `Auto/ShootingAttempted` and `Auto/InAllianceZone` | If `ShootingAttempted` is true but `InAllianceZone` is false, robot thinks it's outside alliance zone — check zone boundaries |

### Controller Input Issues

| Symptom | What to check | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Robot not responding to sticks | Check `Input/Driver/LeftX`, `LeftY`, `RightX` | If values change with sticks, the issue is downstream. If stuck at 0, controller not connected or wrong port |
| Wrong controller is driving | Compare `Input/Driver/` vs `Input/Operator/` values while pressing sticks | Controller may be assigned to wrong role. Check the driver/operator chooser |
